<!-- Multiple Regression to simulate housing price based on user-inputted factors -->

<!-- Our simulation will involve running multivariate regression over different factors like build year, -->
<!-- number of parking spaces, and square footage on housing prices in Austin, TX from 2018 to -->
<!-- 2021. 
In the app, users can input factors about a house and the simulation will return an -->
<!-- estimated market price of the house based on the regression, after taking an average from -->
<!-- using different assumptions about the missing factors/variables. -->

<!-- We will use the distributions of the data for individual variables to randomly sample a value from -->
<!-- when a user does not input a value for that variable and an assumption needs to be made. -->

<!-- If time allows, we can reverse the process, and users may also be able to input a price or -->
<!-- budget range into the app, and the simulation will generate a “house” and what kind of -->
<!-- characteristics a house within that price range or at that price point might have. -->

install.packages('dplyr')

<!-- cut out images from data or other unwanted variables with piping to clean dataset -->
<!-- first create distribution for each individual factor based on existing distribution in data -->
<!-- then create function for each factor that generates random number based on distribution for that factor -->
<!-- then create regression with price as y variable and other variables as multivariate -->
<!-- create function that takes different factors as parameters and returns price based on regression and randomly generated missing variables -->
<!-- make individual factor variables in function user inputtable -->



Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
